This code is used to find solutions to the "Lazors" game with the following criteria:
1. Read in a Lazor board via a text file, using a specified board file format.
2. Use a class object to describe the blocks within the game.
3. Output a file that shows the valid solution.
4. Make sure code runs in a reasonable time (should not take more than a couple minutes)
5. Boards allow for reflect blocks, opaque blocks, refract blocks, and fixed blocks.
